############ Union-based SQL Injection ############
     
    username = ' UNION SELECT NULL, 'a', 'b' -- and password = 

    ' UNION SELECT NULL, 'a', 'b' -- will leave username and password empty

    How it works:

        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' UNION SELECT NULL, 'a', 'b' --' AND password=''

        1. SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' --> will not return any rows 
            because no username is an empty string in the database.

        2. UNION --> Combines rows from two or more SELECT statements. Here, it adds a new row 
            with id = NULL, username = 'a', password = 'b'.

        3. '--'  --> is an SQL comment, remves the AND password='' part of the query, 
            so it doesn't interfere with the UNION operation.

    Execution steps:

        1. The user submite the form with malicious input.

        2. SQL is query string is dynamically generated, including the user's input.
            SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' UNION SELECT NULL, 'a', 'b' --' AND password=''

        3. The query is executed into the database 

        4. The cursor.fetchone() will return the row added by the UNION SELECT, which is (NULL, 'a', 'b').

        5. Since a row is returned ---> " Logged in successfully "
