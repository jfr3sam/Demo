############ Classic SQL Injection ############

    username = ' OR '1'='1 and password = ' OR '1'='1

    '1' = '1' --> is always True

        This will result ---> username and password check will be ignored 

    How it works:

        1. The user submite the form with malicious input.

        2. SQL is query string is dynamically generated, including the user's input.
            SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' OR '1'='1' AND password='' OR '1'='1'

        3. The query is executed into the database

        4. Because the condition '1'='1' is always true, 
            cursor.fetchone() will return the first row it finds in the users table

        5. Since a row is returned ---> " Logged in successfully "
